# Uni
Write a program in C which reads input CPU bursts from a the first  line of a text file named as CPU_BURST.txt. Validate the input numbers whether   //   the number are positive intergers or not. Consider the number as CPU burst.if there are 5 positive integer in the first line of the text file then    //  the program treat those argument as required CPU bust for P1,P2,P3,P4 and P5 process and calculate average waiting time and average turn around time     // Consider used scheduling algorithem as SJF and same arrival time for all the processes
